In this workshop, we address how to get beyond superficial and potentially damaging coverage. Together with experts in journalism and narrative change skilled in what does and doesn\u2019t work, we explore how to create deeply reported stories that respect the experiences of people who\u2019ve come to the U.S. in pursuit of security and to put down roots.Featuring RAICES workshop facilitators Tha\u00eds Silva-Marques and Jorge Rivas and panelists Murad Awawdeh (New York Immigration Coalition), Leslie Berestein Rojas (LAist), Juan Escobedo (East LA Society of Film and Arts), and Astrid Galv\u00e1n (Axios), with RAICES Chief External Affairs Office...",
