Project Name
Immigrow

Proposed Project
Immigrow helps underserved immigrant communities and their allies discover firsthand stories, trustworthy organizations, and nearby resources/events. This includes pulling from platforms like Eventbrite, providing a “Know Your Rights” model with access to legal clinics, ESL classes, and citizenship workshops. The site promotes civic engagement by connecting users to actionable services, multilingual materials, and community events.
