## Comments

This phase focused on setting up core infrastructure and the initial deployment.  
The team collaborated well, with responsibilities split cleanly between frontend development, AWS setup, and GitLab CI/CD configuration. Some challenges arose during the initial DNS propagation and SSL certificate validation, but they were resolved through group debugging sessions.
